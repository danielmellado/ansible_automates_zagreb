What's a Collection?

---
# Collections

## What's a Collection?

* A new wat to distribute Ansible content
  * An artifact format for consistent content structure
  * Contains 1-N of roles, modules, plugins and module utilities
  * Enables versioning of external content
  * Enables consistent delivery independent of Ansible distributions
  * Installable as system, user or project resources
* Immediate use of the content found within the artifact
* Namespacing support built into the collection

---
# Collections

## What problems do collections solve?:

* Difficult distribution of non-role content
--

* Plugin/role name collisions
--

* Difficult code-sharing for most plugins
---
# Collections

## Problem 1: Content Distribution

* Multiple roles with deps? Good luck.

* Roles already distribute plugins- done?
  * Requires role to be "entered" (see also ansible-wtf)
  * Plugins are not "first-class citizens"
  * Versioning/maintenance issues

---
# Collections

## Content Distribution with Collections

* Collection may contain 1-N:
  * Roles/Modules/Plugins
  * Playbooks (future/TBD)

* Collection is the unit of distribution and versioning

* Installable:
  * globally
  * per-user
  * content-adjacent (ie per-project)

---
# Collections

## Instaqlling collections content

* Default paths (searched in this order, configurable)
  * (current playbook)/collections
  * ~/.ansible/collections
  * usr/share/ansible/collections

* Mazer/ansible-galaxy

* Content Hub

---
# Collections

## Problem 2: Name Collisions

* Ansible has a global(ish) flat plugin namespace

* Role1 and Role2 both distribute my_module
  * Which one will get used? (ha!)
  * Can I use them both in the same run? (no
  * What if core later includes a my_module? (screwed)
  * What if the project has in library/ ?
  * What if the user has in ~/.ansible/?
  * What if the system has in /usr/share/ansible ?
  * Issue exists for roles and all modules/plugins

---
# Collections

## Namespacing with Collections

* Collections have a namespace and name
  * For distribution, namespace == Galaxy user/org

* Content in collections is accessed by namespace
  * mynamespace.mycollection.my_module
  * f5.bigip.provisioning_role

* Built-in collections
  * ansible.builtin
  * ansible.legacy

---
# Collections

## Sample Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: somehosts
  tasks:
  - myns.mycollection.athing:

  - ansible.builtin.ping: # use only the ping packaged in core

  - ansible.legacy.ping: # use core or library(etc)/ping.py
    when: thing | myns.mycollection.filter == 42

  - ping: # still works, == ansible.legacy.ping:
```

---

template: section_layout

That's awfully verbose

---
# Collections

## Enter the collections keyword

```yaml
- hosts: somehosts
  collections:
  - ansible.builtin
  - myns.mycollection
  - otherns.othercollection
  tasks:
  - mymodule: # first found in the list of  collections
  - otherns.othercollection.mymodule: # fully-qualified is fine
```

---
# Collections

## Problem 3: Code Sharing

* module_utils only works for modules
  * unless you're "in the box"
  * perverse incentives
* eg, Azure/AWS want to share utility code between
  * modules/actions/inventory/lookup plugins
* Just use pip!

---
# Collections

## Code sharing in Collections

* Entire collection is a Python namespace package
* All installed collection content is accessible
  * even across collections!
  * `ansible_collections` root Python namespace
  * `ansible_collections.mynamespace.mycollection`
